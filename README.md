Purpose for this program was to write a complex todo list. It will be able to generate new lists, delete lists, mark lists, complete list from the command line. It will also be ablet get in a file and write to it as well as commanding the function of the todo list on the file.  

Key Concepts in this program I used is reading in and out of a file called  note.txt. Program was able to take in keyboard commands to dictate the list. The data structure concept I ephazized on this project was mainly  of linked lists, such as sorting, storing, and abstract lists.
